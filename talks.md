**Event:** [Highload++ Armenia](https://highload.am/2022/abstracts/9700)</br>
**Date:** 15-16 December 2022</br>
**Description:** In this talk, I discussed OpenStack as a microservice application. What DevOps/Administrator has to face if he wants to launch own cloud based on OpenStack. What problems arise in such a large and complex system, how to maintain it, and provide a highly available cloud for a client. And how Kubernetes can (or cannot) help with this. In this talk, based on my experience, I told about the tricks, the most common mistakes, and how they can be solved.</br>

**Event:** [Root Conf++](https://rootconf.ru/moscow-rit/2018/abstracts/3402)</br>
**Date:** 28 May 2018</br>
**Description:** The network is the lifeblood of any modern private cloud, and it is also one of the hardest parts to understand, configure, and administer in the cloud. The rapid development of cloud technologies has spurred the emergence of special network equipment, new protocols, new technologies, and cloud IT professionals need to understand how it all works, interacts, and is managed. The main purpose of the report is to tell in detail how the network works in modern private clouds, what technologies are used, how they develop, identify problems, and give recommendations for solving them.<br>
