# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vadim Ponomarev. I am a software architect / DevOps / SRE and IT enthusiast. Primarily, I am a software sngineer who develops cloud systems and networks in the clouds, but I also popularize OpenStack, cloud technologies, and network security.

I actively contribute to open-source projects, especially those related to cloud technologies. Where you can find my activities:
- [Contributions to open-source projects on Github](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+author%3Avelp+archived%3Afalse)
- [Contributions to OpenStack (OpenStack community has its own git and code-review system)](https://review.opendev.org/q/owner:velizarx%2540gmail.com+status:merged)

:microphone: Occasionally, I [speak at conferences](./talks.md).

:heart: I love math, IT technologies, programming, teaching, and rational thinking. I enjoy hiking, snowboarding, weight lifting, and traveling in my spare time.
